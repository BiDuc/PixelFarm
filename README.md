Software and Hardware 2D Rendering Library

1. Software Rendering Technology: 

	1.1 Agg-Sharp

      >Agg-Sharp is the C# port of Anti-Grain Geometry (AGG)  version (version 2.4, BSD license) 
	
    This provides software 'classic' based rendering technology.

    Big thanks goes to to MatterHackers/agg-sharp
	
	1.2 System.Drawing
	
	As usual :)	

2.  Hardware Rendering Technology: OpenGL ES 2.0
    
    This based on OpenGL ES2 and Its Shading Langauge (GLSL).
