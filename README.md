Hardware and Software 2D Rendering Library

1.  Hardware Rendering Technology: OpenGL ES 2.0
    
    This based on OpenGL ES2 and Its Shading Langauge (GLSL).
	
2. Software Rendering Technology: 

	2.1 Agg-Sharp

      >Agg-Sharp is the C# port of Anti-Grain Geometry (AGG)  version (version 2.4, BSD license) 
	
    This provides 'classic' software based rendering technology.

    Big thanks goes to to MatterHackers/agg-sharp
	
	2.2 System.Drawing
	
	As usual :)
